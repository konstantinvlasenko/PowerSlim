Decision tables:
- different semantics - table header executed each for each row ('execute' method), it is always green
- 'Decision:' prefix 
- Should be at least one setter, used in header! Or use #$ trick
- use _ instead of . for nested properties
- symbols in DT
- dynamic DT not supported
- support for result?, length?, time? (Time.Milliseconds...days)


Script tables:
- don't use reject/ensure for booleans


Query:
- 'Value' property
- use _ instead of . for nested properties

Symbol sharing:

powerslim:
- timestamps, elapsed time
- one file (slim.ps1)
- IPs in remote calls work much faster than host names
- SLIM_COMPUTERNAME 

Fitnesse
- autoformat
- keyboard shortcuts - t,v,e, ctrl-s,s (search)
- search: title, content
