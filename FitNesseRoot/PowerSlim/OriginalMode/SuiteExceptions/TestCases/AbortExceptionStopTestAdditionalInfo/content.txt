This test verifies that an ABORT_SLIM_TEST exception stops processing and returns the developer-specified portion text. 

The throw "StopTest" will produce an error and the last show in the table shouldn't execute.

Note: This test page is intentionally disabled and run from the ExceptionTestRunner page.
